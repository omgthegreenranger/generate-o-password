# generate-o-password

## The Task

As per the challenge details, I am asked "to modify starter code to create an application that enables employees to generate random passwords based on criteria that theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished, responsive user interface that adapts to multiple screen sizes."

The HTML and CSS were already in place; nothing needed to be changed there. However, the Javascript is clean and sharp; this was done with assistance with a tutor (which I was not expecting, but absolutely appreciated). I did, however, very much want to make the prompts selectable toggles via HTML and CSS.

## Usage

Easy, the site is available [here](https://omgthegreenranger.github.io/generate-o-password/), just click "Generate a Password" and it will provide one for you based on the details you answer with prompts. Ideally, it would benefit us to include a proper validator to ensure that there are characters from *each selected set* within the password; that was not in the scope of this particular project.
